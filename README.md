# DNetCMS

My student's coursework for 3-rd course. 

This is CMS analog based on .NET Core and Docker. Also support's docker Stack/Swarm. The main thing that would like to use here, was an opportunity to override base pages. 

This work was represented and I found an presentation file, but it only on RU language. Hope it helps to understand what I've done.
